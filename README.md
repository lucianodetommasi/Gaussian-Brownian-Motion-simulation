Gaussian Brownian Motion simulation for Energy Performance Contracting

Comparison between simulation of Geometric Brownian Motion as described in https://quantpy.com.au/stochastic-calculus/simulating-geometric-brownian-motion-gbm-in-python/
and deterministic averaged approximations used in the paper: LU, Yujie; ZHANG, Nan; CHEN, Jiayu. A behavior-based decision-making model for energy performance contracting in building retrofit.Â Energy and Buildings, 2017, 156: 315-326
